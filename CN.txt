CN:

N/W id = IP Add and Subnet Mask

Broadcast Addr = Ip Add OR (Subnet Mask)c

No.of total addresses = 2^hostbits = 2^8

valid host address - 2^8-2



No.of computers = No. of valid IP Addresses = 2^x >=60 so x = 6 and hence 6 host bits i.e. 6 0 bits are required

/ means no.of network bits

/24 means 24 bits = 1 total = 32 bits means 8 host bits so valid hosts = 2^8 - 2

/30 mena 30 bits = 1 means 2 means 2 host bits and 30 network bits so valid hosts = 2^2 - 2
